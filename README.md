## üìÅ Project Overview

### 1. [web-scraping](./src/1.web-scraping/)
Automated data extraction from websites using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`. HTML content is parsed and structured for further data analysis.

### 2. [interacting-api-py](./src/2.interacting-api-py/)
Demonstrates how to interact with public APIs: sending HTTP requests, parsing JSON responses, and integrating external data sources for analysis.

### 3. [Primer-EDA](./src/3.Primer-EDA/)
Initial exploratory data analysis using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. Covers missing data, distribution analysis, and variable relationships.

### 4. [EDA-Regresion-Logistica](./src/4.EDA-Regresion-Logistica/)
Exploratory analysis for logistic regression. Preprocessing, feature selection, and visualization for binary classification tasks.

### 4.1. [machine-learning](./src/4.1.machine-learning/)
General introduction to machine learning with supervised and unsupervised techniques. Includes classification, regression, and clustering using `scikit-learn`.

### 5. [EDA-Regresion-Lineal](./src/5.EDA-Regresion-Lineal/)
Linear regression-oriented EDA. Examines feature relationships, trends, and suitability for linear modeling.

### 6. [EDA-Regresion-Lineal-regularizada](./src/6.EDA-Regresion-Lineal-regularizada/)
Application of regularized linear regression techniques: Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet. Reduces overfitting and highlights important features.

### 7. [Decision-tree](./src/7.Decision-tree/)
Decision tree model for classification. Includes visualization, depth optimization, and analysis of feature importance.

### 8. [Random-forest](./src/8.Random-forest/)
Ensemble learning with Random Forests. Used for both classification and regression, with feature importance evaluation and performance comparisons.

### 9. [Boosting-algoritms](./src/9.Boosting-algoritms/)
Implementation and comparison of AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Includes model tuning and learning curve visualizations.

### 10. [Naive-Bayes-Algoritm](./src/10.Naive-Bayes-Algoritm/)
Text classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Includes tokenization, text cleaning, and model evaluation.

### 11. [Knearest](./src/11.Knearest/)
K-Nearest Neighbors for classification. Includes testing of different `k` values and accuracy analysis.

### 12. [Kmeans](./src/12.Kmeans/)
Clustering with K-Means. Includes cluster visualization and evaluation using elbow method and silhouette score.

### 13. [Serie-temporalP1](./src/13.Serie-temporalP1/)
Time series analysis and forecasting. Includes trend and seasonality decomposition, and ARIMA model development.

### 14. [Deep-learning](./src/14.Deep-learning/)
Introduction to neural networks with `TensorFlow` and `Keras`. Includes sequential models, activation functions, and dropout regularization.

### 15. [Natural-Language-Processing](./src/15.Natural-Language-Processing/)
Text analysis and NLP applications. Covers text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec), and text classification.

### 16. [Despliegue-Render-Flask](./src/16.ML-WebApp-Flask/)
Deployment of Flask applications on Render, including `Procfile` setup, Gunicorn usage, and production-ready configuration.
