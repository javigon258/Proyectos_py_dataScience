review,polarity
love/hate has bug and security issues. i tried to report that facebook and google plus have security issues and it wouldn't allow me to do so! well i just did didn't i! ......,0
whatsapp i use this app now that blackberry messenger has basically gone away. my friends & family live all over the world. this really helps keep us in touch!,1
usefully verry  nice app,1

"wechat wallet still disappears people have been using wechat wallet in the english ios app for ages now with no problems, and yet when i put my android wechat app into english, wallet disappears! please fix the english android app so that wallet doesn't disappear when i change language from chinese to english. wechat wallet is incredibly useful, but only when you can actually use it!",0
wechat 6.3 with wechat out is no longer free hate it for wechat out now as it's no longer free which playback sound of video is muted after finishing call with wechat out. why charge when it's not up to mark yet?,0

"it's been 1 or 2 months and yall still havent fix the this recent december 2015 update has made the gameplay so lopsided that i can not compete with anyone l attack,  there is now no reason for me to invest anymore time in coc.  can no longer protect my loot and no shield",0
the scoring system on facebook gains more points than mobile on jelly levels and i think that needs to be changed. e.g.  using a colour bomb with jellies on candies gives much more points on fb  than mobile. also there are no fish once  u finish jelly levels. please change the scoring system so it is the same for both platforms and that there is no bias against mobile.,0
i love playing candy crush but... why when u go to another episode  you have to wait for along time for example i was in level 50 and i passed it and had to wait 75 hours for episode 3 the game is good and very addictive but i don't like the waiting for the episodes đł by the way good đwork,0
"can't switch back you have to go to phone setting to switch to another keyboard. you should add choose input method on keyboard. if i'm missing it, teach me how to find that",1

"frequently resets once again, it has reset and taken all stored boosters. this has gone on about four times now within a couple of weeks of each other. i don't understand why that information isn't stored, since things like your level and gold are retained.",0

"very good, but reposition and either fix or remove the 'share link' button. the 'bookmarks not syncing' issue was fixed a while back. i have been happy with this app for a while now, i just forgot to change my previous review. that isn't to say that it is without its problems, however. having gotten used to chrome, i find myself pressing 'share link' rather than 'open link in new tab'. while this normally isn't a problem, lately pressing 'share link' causes the app to crash. please either fix this issue and reposition 'share link' lower or remove it altogether.",1
"not too good. please fix the voice and video calling. and then, you know, it'd be nice of there's a kind of sound when a message gets sent, like most texting apps. in this app, though, it just shows now and there's no sound or anything. not a nuisance, but, it's better with a sound.",0
"new version makes it harder to use linkedin especially find the groups you subscribe to and comment in them.  submitting issues doesn't seem to work in the mobile app, the submit button is never enabled. this last update was a loser!",0
account creation issue i tried to create an account but it keeps saying can't create an account at this time,0
viber s.a.r.l. this app helps me to stay in contact while also having video options and picture options. really nice app and pretty stable running. just a few video and audio issues as well as video and call drops which can be annoying. sometimes the app is unstable but is mostly attributed to network issues rather than the app itself. i recommend this app.,1
"new update sucks.... also my base isn't going to my ipad cause your support is rude. title says all, i moved my base to my android cause it got stolen, i bought an iphone and made a new gamecenter account but hey guess what? nope i dont have my first receipt and no i cant tell you the specific date of when i first created my base",0

google messenger and hangouts should become one google messenger and hangouts should become one app that works like imessages except android. if it detects they are using hangouts/google messenger it will send a message in the form of hangouts (which will show up in the conjoined app) but if it doesn't detect them using hangouts/google messenger then it will simply send a sms message instead,0

"cool app except the notifications freeze, so i have no idea of the upload status. even worse dunno if it even worked or safe to delete those files. becomes more of a broken app to me. another issue i wanted to create a new account for a friends new phone. exclaimed that 2 year 50 gig is available and it shows it is until after you waste time following all of your steps to get 250 mbs or something worthless. keep it honest.",0

nice easy way to known about every things.,1
"less space is the magic a complete package with very less space. but still, i would love to see a bit modern design!",1
"it's useful a great app and pretty much an essential part of my organization. a minor complaint is that the desktop program doesn't look as appealing as the mobile app, and that the mobile version is lacking some useful functions (e.g. the ability to delete tags, or to strikethrough text).",0
good,1
not enough space 6g is nothing these days. need at least 32g to store all the memory hungry apps as every update gets bigger and bigger as the quality and functionality get smaller and smaller. please dont go to that material crap !!!  not evertone likes the cheap material design. it is designed for lazy devs who like the easy/lazy way,0
won't make calls i have 5 bars on verizon 4g but it keeps saying can not connect call.  so far had only connected 1 call when i had 1 bar and the other person couldn't hear me. i have tried at over 20 different locations in the city i live in all around 4 or 5 bars.  no calls can be made.  fix this.,1
buggy after update after the update chrome will freeze chrome isn't responding which gives me an option to wait for it or kill the app. this happens every time i reopen the app and some times from recent,0
"garbage. no user choice allow users to lock the toolbar. it makes no sense to hide the url just for a tiny bit of extra vertical space on big screens. also needs option to show tabs on top rather than in a separate screen for the same reason. still no pdf support!? finally, stop unloading tabs when there are gigabytes of free ram. overflow menu is a cluttered mess.",0
"please include membership when viewing lists. i'm on samsung android, and i don't know if this applies with android users in general, but this app version doesn't seem to include the option of seeing what member a user belongs to in viewing lists. it's available on web browser though. please consider including members of list option in the app.",0

"ătoo slow loading webclips!!! ăno pdf support at all... (even simpler apps do that!) ă web pages that are clipped do not adjust to current window size automatically when window is shrunk or expanded, (any program does this...geez). ă highlighting? needs more colors instead of brown mustard yellow. no customer support responses either, evernote must have been taken over by students. it's not even fun to use anymore because it is slow as hell.  this is especially for serious business users. any five star ratings down here must have been given by employees under different themes. this program has really retarded over the years. they need to stick to improving their bread and butter instead of selling side junk and features that are useless. well they got my money this time, so i have to put up with it for a few more months. the lack of pdf support really is terrible for a program like this.",0

huh? i don't get it. i put a password on it and when you go in directly it's required but accessing through my s5's my files it's there at the bottom under cloud storage and there is no password required! how do i stop this security weakness?,0
it was a great game . until the last update . and cost of upgrade for th10 has always been beyond the reach of the average players . and let's not start about the time to wait for the upgrades to finish .  seems like supercell only cares about/wants high level trophy pushers . and they don't want people who don't/can't buy gems to even to touch this game or maybe even like it,0
download stops the iteam iam downloading stop half way or about 13 percent or it just does begin at all. please fix this and ill rate it 5 stars,0
"could be so much better if they'd stop making unneeded changes. while i love twitter, i hate that there is no paid service to remove ads. also there should be a quicker way to access your lists (like a shortcut on the home screen to a specific list would be awesome) and also i've heard that twitter is testing a non-chronological timeline. that is the worst idea ever. if that is implemented without a way to turn it off, i won't use twitter anymore. honestly, if third party apps had push notifications, i wouldn't use the official app at all. oh, and moments is dumb.",0
"keeps crashing i really do love the browser overall and the ability to install add-ons and plug-ins is amazing, but it keeps crashing on me all the time. i'll be browsing a page and then all of a sudden the page won't scroll for me, i'll try and zoom in and the font won't rerender, and i can't click on anything. however, the ui still functions normally, but i can't get anything to work on the webpages. if that could somehow be fixed, it'd ramp ya back up to 5 stars.",0

"great, perfect. no complaints",1
slowly becoming less and less functional functionality within app seems to be diminishing - hangouts does not automatically compress files being sent via mms which results in many of them bouncing back. muted conversations still ring if a new message is received in a non-muted thread. if this is google's way of forcing people to messenger its going to force me off both and i'll use third party apps,0
needs an actual update! twitter slows down. tweets continue to not even send. it takes a long time to load a tweet and the timeline. i have to use the moblie site version to actually use twitter.,0

"absolutely the best for saving documents, forms, notes or whatever it is that you may end up needing on the go.  you can have one or twenty different books to store and organize your information in.  edit word and excel documents without having to save them to your computer and save them again into your books.  tag one document in ten different locations so if you can use it in multiple different situations you don't have to worry about where you saved it.  just look it up under the tag that you need to use it for.  it's that easy!!",1
good need to use every nepali peoples,1

one of the best apps ever at first i was a bit skeptical but i got used to it and now i can't work without it. better even than onenote. at least for what i'm concerned.,1
one account for all devices,1

"organization logo whenever i try to add my organization, on my status it displays linkedin's organization logo, however on my profile the logo isn't there and it looks very plain. can someone explain to me why this may be happening?  (this is on a desktop, by the way)",0
still not background refreshing despite the daily updates this had been working well until a recent version. it no longer refreshes in the background and therefore is very slow to load when i open the app. stop updating things that used to work.,0
useful app very useful app in my opinion. note taking is great with voice recognition. being able to add pics brings a nice presentation aspect when sharing with a group. the functionality just needs to keep improving for the average person to be perfect.,1
pics are not loaded i  love using uc browser but the only erorr i  m facing that when i login fb pic are not loaded... plz fix dis issue,1
"agree with new ui being too much like fb. also, there is literally no way to modify the app settings. the only option given is to view your linkedin apps. why was this removed? major necessity when you're getting spammed everytime someone posts an update.",0
"please do not stop carousel!  google has improved their gallery app (google photo) to make google drive better for photo backup, cannot only store photos, but also create interesting effects, animations and story for users, and even, unlimited space. however, meanwhile, you decided to give up carousel. i am a royal user of dropbox, but don't you know that photo backup is one of the most important things while one chooses an online storage tool? wish this will not be the turning point that dropbox is beaten by google drive.",0
"almost, but not quite. this has so much potential, but i really would like a back function that works, i press back and wait, nothing happens. i press back again and it takes me to the homepage,  same for the back button on the tablet,  i'm using a 1st gen nexus 7.",1
"awesome, but less awesome than before this is a really great communications app, better than any other i've found. but sadly with the last update they took a cool feature away. please bring back the walkie talkie. i know it was silly but you've no idea how much we used it. it's one of those features that just makes it fun to talk again.",0
the only and major problem is it can't provide real-time notification.  but i love the web/desktop notification very much !,1
"almost good enough i have tried lots of android browsers. the reason being that i like speed and simplicity and good bookmark management. that's all i need. i tried firefox (which i use on desktop) as a way of getting away from chrome, because i absolutely hate google and everything and everybody associated with it. seriously, i hate google. unfortunately, chrome is still hands down the best browser i've used on android. firefox started out fine, but became slower and glitchier as i used it, like everything except chrome. meh",1
"ui & customization dark theme and color options. reply directly from the notification panel. options to change contact photos to initials and hide the timestamps. please bring back the gesture that takes you back to the conversation list by swiping from the left edge. write a message area is too cluttered, make it simplistic with a + sign. replace visible phone number with the name of the contact in send sms to...",0
"idk i can't edit my posts? things such as my profile picture, when i edit it, it becomes grey and says that it is no longer available. please fix. i have an htc desire. will rate 5 stars shown fixed đ",0
"twitter is great to connect with my classmates, as i'm on exchange at the moment. however, i cannot view who's liked my posts. it will say there's 9 likes, but will only show me 3. also, the notifications aren't very good, sometimes it won't tell me if someone has followed me or if they've liked/retweeted one of my posts.",0
"latest update should be clientside the most recent update added the following features which need to be changed to client side only: colour, nicknames, and emoji. all three change the appearance of the chat stream and are community controlled. these are issues because they change everyone's layout. they need to be controlled by every individual of their own choosing.",0
wtf it worked for the last 3yrs. then all of a sudden almost all my msgs dont send. and neither does my friends. i tried meeting up with someone recently and we couldnt get each others msgs and missed out. i use to use it with one friend constantly and now it barely works. what the hell,0
"good but not great app is awesome, saves me a ton of memory. but i think it should add a few more features to make use even better... 1) you should had a select all button when moving upload pics to dropbox albums. its a real pain checking individually 250 pictures to move to album. 2.) once pictures are in album, the thumnail should sell you how many pictures are currently in that album... if you could do those 2 things... it would be âââââ",0
"ok for the simple stuff, feature lacking and poor layout for your basic messaging it's fine, but it still lacks sending voice messages and video clips. can be a bit slow to load conversations. overall the recent changes in ui make it feel cloogy. simple actions like opening the app or going back to the message listview shows a signing in spinner -- which is obviously not ideal for every other action, especially since it uses google auth services đ",0
unsatisfactory version older version was more user friendly than this one. i can't see my rank among my connection and colleagues. this is really bad. i wish to revert back to old version.,0
doesn't work anymore before the last update it worked just fine on my tablet but now it will start to open then close down.,0
"are you serious, there is no widget available?",0
its cool my brother doesnt bug m me anymore i show him angry birds and his mouth shuts but some levels are almost impossible and i have to wait for free power ups or buy them,1
"app continuously losses connection, at times i have to close app and reopen for it to reconnect. every message also takes around 10 seconds to send",0
"way below expection. why does it lag so much? scroll garda ni freeze hunxa. get it right, kntipur. i expected so much.",0
"can't install (error code: -505) have samsung galaxy note edge, had issues and couldn't update so i uninstalled the app and now i can't reinstall it. total bs!",0
"sort it out why can i not get my networks posts in recent order on my mobile app? on my pc it happens, why am i looking at post from 1day ago before  posts say happening 1 hour ago? this is so annoying, how do you sort it out? also your help centre on mobile  is not working hence i have had to resort to this. what is going on?",0
"what the heck?! can't get status updates to be in chronological order...half of my comments don't post...it worked fine before the last update...keeps kicking me out of the app for no reason.  won't let me tag people without their name being all jumbled. if i edit a post, it shows the unedited version at the top of my feed. i'm 2 seconds away from uninstalling.",0
